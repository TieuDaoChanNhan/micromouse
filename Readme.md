# Micromouse Robot - Autonomous Maze Solver

This repository contains the code and documentation for our Micromouse robot, designed to autonomously navigate mazes. Built as part of a robotics competition, this project highlights our efforts in mechatronics, algorithm design, and teamwork.

## Features
- **PID Control**: Precision motor control for smooth and accurate navigation.
- **Flood-Fill Algorithm**: Efficient maze-solving logic to compute the shortest path.
- **Scalability**: Tested in 6x6 mazes, with attempts to optimize for 12x12 mazes.
- **Collaborative Design**: Developed through team collaboration, combining software and hardware expertise.
